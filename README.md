Analysis on DUI using Regression Discontinuity

This was a research paper I wrote as I was finishing up my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, in a course under Dr. Carlos Dobkin.

# What was the problem we were trying to solve?
We wanted to know whether the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) was actually causing (empahsis on causality) its desired effects. What would those effects be, you might ask? We wanted to know whether it reduced under age drinking, as well as whether it prevented undesired outcomes caused by drinking. In our case, we worried about crime.


# How do we determine causality?
We use a quasi-experimental design called Regression Discontinuity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_discontinuity_design) to determine the causal effect of the MLDA on underaged drinking and crime. 

We define a "running variable" on the x-axis that out sample is not able to control (age). Since the sample is not able to control the variable, it eliminates selection bias.

## Effects
We find that the MLDA reduces the amount of drinkers by 9.1 percentage points and arrests rates by 82.73 per 10,000 person-years. These findings illustrate that the MLDA has a significant impact on the reduction of drinking and crime among young adults.

Further findings are presented in the figures below.

Analysis on DUI using Regression Discontinuity

This was a research paper I wrote as I was finishing up my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, with a class under Dr. Carlos Dobkin.

# What was the problem we were trying to solve?
We wanted to know whether the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) was actually causing (empahsis on causality) its desired effects. What would those effects be, you might ask? We wanted to know whether it reduced under age drinking, as well as whether it prevented undesired outcomes caused by drinking. In our case, we worried about crime.


# How do we determine causality?
We use a quasi-experimental design called Regression Discontinuity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_discontinuity_design) to determine the causal effect of the MLDA on underaged drinking and
